# 0.4.1

Reduce model loading delays: compressed authenticated scene responses, private ETag revalidation, and a bounded session cache shared by the dashboard and model manager. Reuse concurrent downloads, invalidate after model replacement, retry failed requests, and show download/preparation progress. Preserve scene quality and existing uploads.

# 0.4.0

Consolidate model storage, upload, entity mappings, lighting controls, sidebar manager and dashboard card into a single HACS Integration. Automatically load the bundled card through Home Assistant. Add room exports carrying mappings for migration from the old add-on. Retain the add-on as a migration/development path.

# 0.3.2

Keep every wall visible from every camera angle in both the dashboard card and app viewer.

# 0.3.1

Use a front-facing perspective by default, keep the actual pendant visible in cutaway views, and open native Home Assistant controls when clicking mapped fixtures. Include keyboard access and a local light-control preview. Keep the previous floor camera available with view: floor.

# 0.3.0

Add a clean overhead floor view and a native Home Assistant dashboard card without entity icons. Keep private models in the add-on, load them with a HA Ingress session, and reflect live lighting from dashboard state. Add model-specific dashboard setup/download, camera framing and authenticated transport tests. Local generated ZIPs now save in the app project's model-exports folder.

# 0.2.0

Add capability-aware RGB color, Kelvin white temperature, device effects and fade settings. Reflect reported color in the 3D fixture and emitted light. Enforce supported features and temperature limits on the backend, preserve compatibility with existing packages, and add capability/conversion/API tests.

# 0.1.0

Initial model library, prepared ZIP/GLB imports, stable light metadata, entity mapping, preview lighting and Home Assistant WebSocket bridge. Includes Ingress packaging and persistent model storage. This is an early build pending HA OS device validation.
